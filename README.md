# Brush Calligraphy Stroke Segmentation Dataset (BCSS)

## Introduction

The Brush Calligraphy Stroke Segmentation Dataset (BCSS) is a comprehensive dataset designed for the task of brush calligraphy stroke segmentation. It is constructed based on the Evaluated Chinese Calligraphy Copies (E3C) dataset [^1], an aesthetic evaluation dataset of Chinese brush calligraphy, and includes additional images from various sources to enhance diversity and support the evaluation of model generalization.

## Dataset Structure

![dataset](src/dataset.png)

BCSS consists of 1,322 images with 10,653 annotated strokes, divided into the following subsets:

- Training and Validation Set: 1,022 images from the E3C dataset.
- External Testing Set: 300 images, including:
  - 90 images from E3C dataset, containing character types unseen in the training and validation sets.
  - 113 handwritten images extracted from the CCSE-W dataset[^2].
  - 97 images covering different styles of Chinese characters, including regular printed and brush calligraphy such as Clerical Script.

## Applications

BCSS can be used to train and evaluate models for brush calligraphy stroke segmentation tasks. It provides a diverse range of Chinese character styles and a comprehensive testing set to assess the generalization capability of the models.

## Access

The BCSS dataset is publicly available for research purposes. We will publish the dataset in the near future!
